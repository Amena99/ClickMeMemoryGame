#### Game Instructions: 
1. Click on an Avenger image. After your click, the Avenger images will reorganize on the page in a different order. Now it is up to you to click on a different Avenger each time, never re-clicking one that you have previously clicked! 

2. As you click a new Avenger each time, your score will go up.

3. If you re-click an Avenger, your score will go down to zero, but if it was the highest score you received so far, it will be saved as a 'Top Score'. Try to get the highest Top Score possible: 12!
